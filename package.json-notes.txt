@ todo-1 We should use a newer version of "hadhat".
  todo-1 Comment-202408026 explains why.

@ todo-1 "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox" version is currently 2.0.2, which a bit too old.
  todo-1 It could make sense to upgrage it to 4.0.0.
  todo-1 But that would result in a version conflict with other packages.

@ todo-1 "@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades" version is currently 1.28.0, which a bit too old.
  todo-1 It could make sense to upgrage it to 2.5.1.
  todo-1 But possible implications of the upgrade need to be studied.
