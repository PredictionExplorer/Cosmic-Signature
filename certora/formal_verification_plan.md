# Formal Verification Plan for Cosmic Signature Contracts

> **Audience**: Junior-to-mid-level Solidity / Certora engineers.  
> **Goal**: Achieve _complete_ formal verification coverage for **all** production Solidity files and their cross-contract interactions using Certora Prover.
> **Target**: ROCK SOLID code with exactly 0 bugs or unexpected behaviors.
> **Last Updated**: November 2025 - Status Review & Corrections

## Phase 1 Completion Summary (June 6, 2025) ‚úÖ

**Successfully Verified:**
1. **StakingCSNDivisionSafety.spec** (4 rules) - Prevents division by zero in StakingWalletCosmicSignatureNft
2. **StakingRWRandomSelection.spec** (6 rules) - Ensures safe random selection in StakingWalletRandomWalkNft
3. **CSTAccessControl.spec** (7 rules) - Verifies CosmicSignatureToken access control
4. **SystemConfigAccess.spec** (8 rules) - Protects SystemManagement configuration
5. **PrizesWalletCritical.spec** (3 rules) - Verifies access control for PrizesWallet
6. **PrizesWalletSafety.spec** (8 rules) - Comprehensive safety properties for PrizesWallet

**Total: 36 new rules verified with 100% pass rate**

**Key Findings:**
- StakingWalletCosmicSignatureNft division-by-zero is handled gracefully via try-catch
- All critical access control and edge cases verified (including PrizesWallet)
- Some specs removed due to technical limitations (documented below)
- PrizesWallet positive case (game can deposit) remains unverifiable despite extensive effort - significant finding

## 0  High-Level Strategy

1. **Catalogue & Baseline** ‚Äì create an authoritative list of every contract, library, interface, and existing `.spec` / `.conf` file. Map current coverage vs. codebase.
2. **Per-Contract Verification** ‚Äì for each contract write or extend specs that cover:  
   ‚Ä¢ Functional correctness  ‚Ä¢ Access control  ‚Ä¢ Re-entrancy  ‚Ä¢ Arithmetic / overflow  ‚Ä¢ Upgradeability (if relevant)  ‚Ä¢ Event emission  ‚Ä¢ Economic invariants
3. **Cross-Contract & System Invariants** ‚Äì write specs that reason about flows spanning multiple contracts (ETH, CST, NFTs, storage coupling).
4. **Edge Case Analysis** ‚Äì systematically identify and verify all edge cases, including:
   ‚Ä¢ Division by zero scenarios  ‚Ä¢ Overflow/underflow conditions  ‚Ä¢ Empty arrays/mappings  ‚Ä¢ Maximum values  ‚Ä¢ Timing edge cases  ‚Ä¢ Address collisions
5. **Regression Harness** ‚Äì build a Certora CI pipeline (e.g. GitHub Actions) that runs _all_ proofs on every PR.
6. **Maintenance** ‚Äì document rules for updating specs when business logic evolves.

> We follow an **inside-out** order: start with leaf contracts (libraries, tokens, wallets) ‚Üí core game modules ‚Üí umbrella orchestrator ‚Üí whole-system invariants.

2. ~~**CosmicSignatureToken** - Core ERC20 token completely unverified~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED (7 rules)
3. ~~**SystemManagement** - Configuration changes could break invariants~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED (8 rules)
4. ~~**RandomWalkNFT** - NFT minting and ownership unverified~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED (10 rules)
5. **Direct contract verification** - Most specs only verify through CosmicSignatureGame
6. **Cross-contract invariants** - No holistic system properties verified

### 2.3  Existing Spec Summary

**Bidding Mechanics (48+ rules across 7 specs):**
- BiddingMechanics.spec (7 rules)

**NFT Verification (NEW - 10 rules across 1 spec):**
- NFTMinting.spec (10 rules) ‚úÖ - Comprehensive minting security for RandomWalkNFT

**Total: 154 rules passing** (92 existing + 62 new)

**Removed Specs (due to technical issues):**
- StakingRWStateConsistency.spec - Fundamental misunderstanding of contract's dual-array system
- StakingRWArrayIntegrity.spec - Ghost variable synchronization issues 
- CSTTokenSupply.spec - Expected invariant violations from minting/burning operations

**Notable Verification Challenges:**
- **PrizesWallet gameCanDeposit test** - Despite extensive effort (15+ different approaches), could not prove that authorized game contract can successfully deposit ETH. This is a **CRITICAL FINDING** that suggests:
  - Certora cannot properly model OpenZeppelin's Context._msgSender() pattern
  - The contract uses `_msgSender() != game` for access control, but Certora cannot guarantee `_msgSender() == e.msg.sender`
  - **Approaches attempted**: Direct assertions, hardcoded addresses, method summaries, ghost variables, harness contracts, multiple constraint variations
  - **Impact**: Access control verified (non-game addresses CANNOT deposit ‚úÖ), but positive case unverifiable (game CAN deposit ‚ùå)
  - **Recommendation**: This warrants manual review of the Context pattern implementation and potentially adding explicit tests in the test suite

```

Components:
- Track all msg.value across all entry points
- Sum balances: Game + PrizesWallet + StakingWallets + Charity
- Account for all distributions and withdrawals

### 4.2  Token Supply Invariant

```

### 4.4  Round State Machine Invariant

```
Invariant: Round states follow: Inactive ‚Üí Active ‚Üí Claiming ‚Üí Inactive
Invariant: roundNum increases exactly by 1 per successful claim
```

### 4.5  Staking Consistency Invariant

```
Invariant: numStakedNfts = count(non-zero stake actions)
Invariant: ‚àÄ staked NFT, staking contract owns it
```

### 4.6  Time Monotonicity Invariant

```
Invariant: roundActivationTime[n+1] > mainPrizeTime[n]
Invariant: timestamps never decrease within a round
```

### 4.7  Critical Division-by-Zero Invariant

## 5  Advanced Verification Techniques

### 5.1  Ghost Variables & Functions

Use ghost variables to track:
- Cumulative ETH flows
- Historical state transitions
- Cross-contract call sequences
- Invariant violation counts

### 5.2  Inductive Invariants

Prove properties hold:
1. Initially (after constructor/initialize)
2. After every possible state transition
3. Across contract upgrades

### 5.3  Temporal Properties

Verify sequences like:
- "If bid placed, then eventually prize claimable"
- "If NFT staked, then always unstakeable"
- "If round started, then must complete"

    function getNumStakedNfts() external returns (uint256) envfree;
    function deposit() external payable;
}

rule noDivisionByZeroInDeposit {

    // Scenario: no NFTs staked
    require getNumStakedNfts() == 0;
    
    // Attempt deposit
    deposit@withrevert(e);
    
    // Should revert gracefully, not panic
    assert lastReverted;
}

## 8  Verification Best Practices

### 8.1  Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Assuming Inheritance Coverage** - Verify each contract directly
2. **Ignoring View Functions** - They can have bugs too
3. **Skipping Edge Cases** - Test all boundaries
4. **Incomplete Harnesses** - Mock all external dependencies
5. **Weak Invariants** - Make them as strong as possible

### 8.2  Performance Optimization

1. Use `--optimistic_loop` for bounded loops
2. Leverage `havoc` statements for large mappings
3. Split complex rules into smaller ones
4. Use ghost variables to track cumulative state
5. Parallelize independent proofs

## 10  Comprehensive Verification Requirements

### 10.1  Minimum Coverage for "Rock Solid" Code

Each production contract MUST have:
1. **Access Control Spec** - Verify all restricted functions

## 12  Definition of Comprehensive Verification

### 12.1  What "Extremely Comprehensive" Means

For the Cosmic Signature codebase to have extremely comprehensive formal verification:

1. **100% Contract Coverage**: Every single production contract must have dedicated verification
2. **100% Function Coverage**: Every public/external function must have at least one rule
3. **100% Path Coverage**: Every possible execution path must be verified
4. **100% Integration Coverage**: Every cross-contract interaction must be proven safe
5. **100% Economic Coverage**: Every ETH/token flow must be tracked and verified

### 12.2  Verification Depth Requirements

For each contract, we need:
- **Positive tests**: Verify correct behavior works
- **Negative tests**: Verify incorrect usage fails safely  
- **Edge case tests**: Verify boundary conditions handled
- **Integration tests**: Verify interactions with other contracts
- **Invariant tests**: Verify properties that must always hold

### 12.3  Missing Coverage Analysis

Based on current state, we need approximately:
- **25+ new spec files** for uncovered contracts
- **200+ new rules** for comprehensive coverage
- **9 system invariants** to be implemented
- **50+ edge case rules** for boundary testing
- **30+ integration rules** for cross-contract verification

## 12.5  Critical Unresolved Verification Challenges

### PrizesWallet._msgSender() Pattern

**Issue**: Cannot prove that the game contract can successfully deposit ETH, despite verifying that non-game addresses cannot.

**Root Cause**: OpenZeppelin's Context pattern uses `_msgSender()` instead of `msg.sender` directly. Certora cannot establish the equivalence `_msgSender() == e.msg.sender`.

**Severity**: HIGH - This affects verification completeness for any contract using the Context pattern.

**Recommendation**: 
1. Add comprehensive unit tests specifically for positive cases
2. Consider documenting this as a known limitation of formal verification
3. Review if direct `msg.sender` usage would be acceptable for critical access control

## 13  Key Findings from Comprehensive Review (June 2025)

### 11.0  Important Verification Update

**‚úÖ StakingWalletCosmicSignatureNft Division by Zero - VERIFIED SAFE**

Through formal verification with Certora (StakingCSNDivisionSafety.spec), we've confirmed that the apparent division-by-zero vulnerability at line 161 is actually handled gracefully:
- The panic is caught by a try-catch block in MainPrize.sol
- Funds are redirected to charity when no NFTs are staked
- No funds are lost, no state corruption occurs
- This is a deliberate design pattern, not a bug

### 11.1  Coverage Reality Check

The initial assessment was misleading - most functionality IS verified, but through `CosmicSignatureGame.sol` rather than individual contracts. This is both good and bad:

**Good**: 
- 81+ rules passing across 17 spec files
- Comprehensive bidding and prize claiming coverage
- Core game mechanics thoroughly tested

**Bad**:
- No direct contract verification means upgrade risks
- Contract-specific invariants may be missed
- Harder to maintain as system grows

### 11.2  Critical Gaps Identified

1. **Staking Wallets** - Completely unverified despite known bugs
2. **Token Contracts** - Core economic primitives have zero specs
3. **System Management** - Configuration changes could break everything
4. **Cross-Contract Invariants** - No holistic system properties verified

### 11.3  Recommended Verification Strategy

1. **Fix Critical Bugs First** - Don't verify broken code
2. **Direct Contract Specs** - Each contract needs its own harness
3. **Integration Tests** - Verify cross-contract interactions
4. **Continuous Verification** - CI/CD pipeline is essential

### 11.4  Risk Assessment Update

| Risk Level | Count | Examples |
|------------|-------|----------|
| CRITICAL | 2 | StakingRW unverified, CST token |
| HIGH | 5 | System management, NFT contracts, wallet ETH flows |
| MEDIUM | 7 | Libraries, utilities, base contracts |
| LOW | 4 | DAO, helpers, simple validators |

### 11.5  Success Criteria

The codebase will be considered "ROCK SOLID" when:
1. Zero division-by-zero possibilities ‚úÖ (Phase 1 complete)
2. All contracts have direct verification ‚ùå (Only 4/30+ done)
3. System invariants proven across all contracts ‚ùå (0/9 implemented)
4. 100% of economic flows verified ‚ùå (Missing ETH conservation)
5. Upgrade safety guaranteed ‚ùå (Not yet verified)

## 14  Path to Comprehensive Verification

### 14.1  Current Status Summary
- **Verified**: 4 contracts (CST, SystemManagement, StakingCSN partial, StakingRW partial)
- **Partially Verified**: ~10 contracts (via CosmicSignatureGame inheritance)
- **Unverified**: ~20 contracts
- **System Invariants**: 0/9 implemented
- **Total Rules**: 108 passing (need ~300+ for comprehensive coverage)

### 14.2  Required Effort Estimate
To achieve truly comprehensive verification:
- **Time**: 6-8 weeks of focused effort
- **New Specs**: 25-30 spec files
- **New Rules**: 200+ additional rules
- **Invariants**: All 9 system-wide invariants
- **Integration Tests**: 30+ cross-contract verifications

### 14.3  Highest Priority Actions (Do These First!)
1. **PrizesWallet.sol** - Critical ETH custody contract with zero coverage
2. **NFT Contracts** - Both CosmicSignatureNft and RandomWalkNFT need direct verification
3. **ETH Conservation Invariant** - Track all ETH flows across the system
4. **Complete StakingWallet verification** - We only verified safety, not functionality
5. **CharityWallet & MarketingWallet** - Withdrawal limits are critical

## 15  Risks of Current Incomplete Verification

### 15.1  Unverified Attack Vectors

With current limited coverage, the following attacks remain possible:
1. **ETH Drainage** - PrizesWallet has no verification, could have withdrawal bugs
2. **NFT Exploits** - Minting limits not verified, could mint unlimited NFTs
3. **Wallet Draining** - Charity/Marketing wallets lack withdrawal verification
4. **State Corruption** - Base contracts could have storage collision bugs
5. **Economic Attacks** - No system-wide economic invariants verified

### 15.2  False Confidence Risk

Current "108 rules passing" gives false confidence because:
- Most rules only test through CosmicSignatureGame proxy
- Direct contract bugs could be hidden by proxy layer
- Integration bugs between contracts not tested
- System-wide properties completely unverified

### 15.3  Technical Debt Accumulation

Without comprehensive verification:
- New features add untested complexity
- Bug fixes might introduce new bugs
- Refactoring becomes risky
- Upgrade safety cannot be guaranteed

## Appendix A - Known Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

1. **StakingWalletCosmicSignatureNft.sol:161** - ‚úÖ VERIFIED: Gracefully handled via try-catch
2. **No direct contract verification** - All specs target CosmicSignatureGame
3. **Missing token verification** - CST, NFTs unverified
4. **No cross-contract invariants** - System-wide properties unverified
5. **Unverified randomness** - RandomNumberHelpers needs verification

## Appendix B - Tool Configuration

### Optimal Certora Configuration

```json
{
  "files": ["contracts/**/*.sol"],
  "solc": "0.8.29",
  "verify": "Contract:specs/Contract.spec",
  "optimistic_loop": true,
  "loop_iter": 3,
  "rule_sanity": "basic",
  "msg": "Comprehensive verification run"
}
```

### Recommended Flags

- `--optimistic_loop` for bounded loops
- `--loop_iter 3` for reasonable unrolling
- `--rule_sanity basic` to catch spec errors
- `--cache` for faster re-runs
- `--staging` for latest features

## 5  Critical Vulnerabilities Requiring Immediate Attention

### 5.1  StakingWalletCosmicSignatureNft Division by Zero - HANDLED GRACEFULLY ‚úì

**Location**: `StakingWalletCosmicSignatureNft.sol:161`
```solidity
uint256 rewardAmountPerStakedNftIncrement_ = msg.value / numStakedNftsCopy_;
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ **NOT A BUG - Gracefully Handled**
**Verification**: Confirmed via Certora test `StakingCSNDivisionSafety.spec`

**How it works**:
1. When `numStakedNfts == 0`, the division causes a Solidity panic (error code 0x12)
2. The `deposit()` function is only called from `MainPrize.sol` within a try-catch block
3. The catch block specifically handles `Panic.DIVISION_BY_ZERO` and redirects funds to charity
4. No funds are lost, no contract state is corrupted

**Verified Test Results**:
```
rule depositRevertsWhenNoNftsStaked: SUCCESS ‚úì
- Confirms deposit reverts when no NFTs staked
- Division by zero panic is properly triggered

rule depositRequiresStakedNfts: SUCCESS ‚úì  
- Invariant holds that successful deposits require staked NFTs
```

**Code Flow**:
```solidity
// In MainPrize.sol
try stakingWalletCosmicSignatureNft.deposit{value: amount}(roundNum) {
    // Normal flow when NFTs are staked
} catch Panic(uint256 errorCode_) {
    if(errorCode_ != OpenZeppelinPanic.DIVISION_BY_ZERO) {
        OpenZeppelinPanic.panic(errorCode_);
    }
    // Division by zero case: redirect to charity
    charityEthDonationAmount_ += amount;
}
```
