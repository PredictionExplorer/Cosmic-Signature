# Comprehensive Formal Verification Plan for Cosmic Signature Contracts

> **Objective**: Achieve 100% formal verification coverage for ALL production Solidity contracts with zero bugs or unexpected behaviors.
> **Standard**: Every contract, every function, every edge case, every invariant must be formally verified.
> **Last Updated**: June 11, 2025

## Executive Summary

The Cosmic Signature protocol consists of 52 production Solidity files (31 contracts + 21 interfaces/libraries). Currently, only 133 rules are implemented with 1 critical sanity failure. This plan outlines the path to achieve **500+ verification rules** covering every possible vulnerability, edge case, and system invariant.

**Critical Finding**: Current verification is insufficient. Only ~30% of contracts have any verification, and most are verified indirectly through integration tests rather than direct contract verification.

### Current vs Target State
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| Total Rules | 133 | 500+ | 367+ |
| Sanity Failures | 1 | 0 | -1 |
| Contracts Verified | ~10 (indirect) | 31 (direct) | 21 |
| System Invariants | 0 | 10 | 10 |
| Attack Vectors Covered | ~20% | 100% | 80% |
| CI/CD Integration | None | Full | 100% |

### Verification Priority Matrix
| Priority | Contracts | Risk if Unverified | Timeline |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | Game, Wallets, Tokens, NFTs | Total loss of funds | Week 1-2 |
| **HIGH** | Staking, System, Base contracts | Partial loss, exploits | Week 3-4 |
| **MEDIUM** | Utilities, DAO, Libraries | Limited impact | Week 5-6 |
| **LOW** | Validators, Helpers | Minimal risk | Week 7-8 |

## Comprehensive Verification Requirements

### 1. Access Control Verification (Every Contract)
For EVERY contract with restricted functions:
- **Owner-only functions**: Verify non-owners cannot call
- **Game-only functions**: Verify only authorized game can call
- **Multi-role functions**: Verify complex permission logic
- **Modifier bypasses**: Verify no way to bypass modifiers
- **Reentrancy**: Verify all external calls are protected

### 2. ETH Flow Verification (Critical)
Every contract that handles ETH must verify:
- **ETH Conservation**: Sum of ETH in = Sum of ETH out + Sum of ETH held
- **No ETH Lock**: ETH cannot be permanently locked
- **Withdrawal Safety**: Only authorized withdrawals
- **Fallback Safety**: receive() and fallback() functions safe
- **Force ETH**: Handle forced ETH via selfdestruct

### 3. Token & NFT Verification
- **Supply Invariants**: totalSupply = sum of all balances
- **Minting Limits**: Cannot exceed max supply
- **Burning Safety**: Cannot burn more than owned
- **Transfer Integrity**: Ownership properly transferred
- **Approval Mechanics**: Allowances work correctly

### 4. Mathematical Safety
- **No Division by Zero**: Every division has non-zero divisor
- **No Overflow**: Despite Solidity 0.8 checks
- **No Underflow**: Subtraction safety
- **Percentage Calculations**: Sum to 100% exactly
- **Random Number Safety**: No bias or manipulation

### 5. State Machine Verification
- **Round Transitions**: Proper state transitions
- **No Stuck States**: Always a way forward
- **Atomic Updates**: State changes are atomic
- **Event Emission**: All state changes emit events
- **Storage Consistency**: No conflicting state

### 6. Upgrade Safety (CRITICAL)
- **Storage Layout**: Preserved across upgrades
- **Initialization**: Can only initialize once
- **Gap Usage**: Reserved gaps properly used
- **Proxy Pattern**: UUPS implementation correct
- **No Storage Collisions**: Inheritance doesn't break storage

### 7. Time-Based Verification
- **Timestamp Monotonicity**: Time always moves forward
- **Deadline Enforcement**: Time limits enforced
- **No Timestamp Manipulation**: Resistant to miner manipulation
- **Activation Timing**: Rounds activate at correct times
- **Timeout Handling**: Proper timeout behavior

### 8. Array & Mapping Safety
- **Bounds Checking**: No out-of-bounds access
- **Dense Array Integrity**: No gaps in dense arrays
- **Deletion Handling**: Proper cleanup on deletion
- **Enumeration Safety**: Can safely enumerate
- **Gas Limits**: Loops can't exceed block gas

### 9. External Integration Safety
- **Oracle Safety**: If using price oracles
- **Callback Handling**: Safe from malicious callbacks
- **Interface Compliance**: Implements interfaces correctly
- **Cross-Contract Calls**: Safe from failures
- **Gas Forwarding**: Appropriate gas limits

### 10. Economic Invariants
- **No Value Extraction**: Users can't extract more than put in
- **Fair Distribution**: Prizes distributed as specified
- **No Front-Running**: Protected against MEV attacks
- **Auction Integrity**: Prices follow intended curves
- **Staking Fairness**: Rewards proportional to stake

## System-Wide Invariants (Must Hold Across ALL Contracts)

### Invariant 1: ETH Conservation
```
∑(ETH sent to system) = ∑(ETH in contracts) + ∑(ETH distributed) + ∑(ETH in prizes)
```

### Invariant 2: Token Conservation
```
CST.totalSupply() = ∑(all CST balances) - ∑(burned CST)
```

### Invariant 3: NFT Uniqueness
```
∀ tokenId ∈ [1, totalSupply]: exactly one owner exists
∀ tokenId > totalSupply: no owner exists
```

### Invariant 4: Round Monotonicity
```
roundNumber[t+1] = roundNumber[t] OR roundNumber[t] + 1
activationTime[n+1] > endTime[n]
```

### Invariant 5: Staking Consistency
```
∑(staked NFTs) = ∑(NFTs owned by staking contracts)
∀ staker: claimable rewards ≤ proportional share of deposits
```

### Invariant 6: Bid Price Monotonicity
```
∀ round n, bid i+1: ETH_price[i+1] > ETH_price[i]
∀ t ∈ [start, end]: CST_price(t) ≤ CST_price(t-1)
```

### Invariant 7: Access Control Consistency
```
∀ restricted function f: can only be called by authorized roles
∀ contract c: owner[c] ≠ 0 → owner[c] can call onlyOwner functions
```

### Invariant 8: Storage Non-Corruption
```
∀ upgrade from v1 to v2: storage layout preserved
∀ contract with gaps: gaps decrease monotonically with new variables
```

### Invariant 9: Prize Distribution Integrity
```
mainPrize + ∑(secondaryPrizes) + charityDonation = totalPrizePool
∑(distributed prizes) ≤ ∑(collected funds)
```

### Invariant 10: Time Consistency
```
∀ round n: startTime[n] < mainPrizeTime[n] < endTime[n]
block.timestamp ≥ all stored timestamps
```

{
  "files": ["contracts/production/**/*.sol"],
  "solc": "0.8.29",
  "optimistic_loop": true,
  "loop_iter": 3,
  "rule_sanity": "basic",
  "smt_timeout": 1200,
  "method": "bounded",
  "msg": "Comprehensive verification"
}
```

## Additional Critical Vulnerabilities to Verify

### Reentrancy Attack Vectors
Every external call must be verified against:
1. **Classic Reentrancy**: State changes before external calls
2. **Cross-Function Reentrancy**: Multiple functions sharing state
3. **Cross-Contract Reentrancy**: Callbacks from other contracts
4. **Read-Only Reentrancy**: View functions called during state changes

### MEV Attack Resistance
1. **Sandwich Attacks**: Bid manipulation by MEV bots
2. **Front-Running**: Prize claims and high-value bids
3. **Back-Running**: Following profitable transactions
4. **Time-Bandit Attacks**: Reorg-based exploitation

### Gas Optimization Attacks
1. **Block Gas Limit**: Loops that exceed block gas
2. **Griefing via Gas**: Making functions too expensive
3. **Storage Packing**: Inefficient storage usage
4. **Calldata Optimization**: Expensive parameter passing

### Cryptographic Vulnerabilities
1. **Weak Randomness**: Predictable random numbers
2. **Signature Malleability**: If using signatures
3. **Hash Collisions**: In mapping keys
4. **Commitment Schemes**: If used for bidding

### Economic Exploits
1. **Flash Loan Attacks**: Instant liquidity exploitation
2. **Oracle Manipulation**: If using price feeds
3. **Arbitrage Opportunities**: Unintended profit paths
4. **Liquidity Draining**: Removing all valuable assets

## Specific Contract Vulnerabilities

### CosmicSignatureGame.sol
- **Storage Collision**: With inherited contracts
- **Initialization Front-Running**: Racing initialization
- **Upgrade Authorization**: Bypassing upgrade controls
- **Round State Corruption**: Invalid state transitions

### Wallet Contracts
- **Forced ETH Reception**: Via selfdestruct
- **Delegation Vulnerabilities**: If using delegatecall
- **Approval Race Conditions**: In token transfers
- **Dust Attacks**: Small value transfers

### NFT Contracts
- **Metadata Manipulation**: URI changes
- **Enumeration DoS**: Large token counts
- **Transfer Hook Exploits**: In onERC721Received
- **Minting Race Conditions**: Concurrent mints

### Staking Contracts
- **Reward Calculation Errors**: Rounding issues
- **Stake Weight Manipulation**: Gaming the system
- **Compound Interest Bugs**: If applicable
- **Withdrawal Timing Attacks**: Exploiting delays

## Testing Methodology

### Formal Methods
1. **Symbolic Execution**: All paths explored
2. **Model Checking**: State space verification
3. **Theorem Proving**: Mathematical proofs
4. **Invariant Testing**: Property-based testing

### Edge Case Categories
1. **Zero Values**: 0 ETH, 0 tokens, empty arrays
2. **Maximum Values**: uint256.max, array limits
3. **Boundary Values**: Just above/below thresholds
4. **Concurrent Operations**: Same block transactions
5. **Time Boundaries**: Exact deadline moments

### Attack Simulation
1. **Malicious Contracts**: Evil callbacks
2. **Resource Exhaustion**: DoS attempts
3. **State Manipulation**: Storage corruption
4. **Economic Attacks**: Profit extraction

        "@openzeppelin=node_modules/@openzeppelin"
    ],
    "solc": "solc8.29"
}
```

## Conclusion

The current verification coverage is dangerously incomplete. With only 133 rules covering a fraction of contracts through indirect testing, critical vulnerabilities may exist. This plan outlines the path to achieve true comprehensive verification with 500+ rules, direct contract verification, and complete system invariant coverage.

**Estimated Timeline**: 8 weeks
**Estimated Rules**: 500-600
**Success Probability**: 100% with proper resources

### Example Certora Rule Implementations

#### Access Control Rule Example
```cvl
rule onlyOwnerCanSetCharityAddress {
    env e;
    address newCharity;
    
    // Get current owner
    address owner = owner();
    
    // Try to set charity address
    setCharityAddress@withrevert(e, newCharity);
    
    // Should only succeed if caller is owner
    assert e.msg.sender != owner => lastReverted;
    assert e.msg.sender == owner => !lastReverted;
}
```

#### ETH Conservation Rule Example
```cvl
ghost uint256 totalEthIn;
ghost uint256 totalEthOut;

hook Svalue uint256 amount {
    totalEthIn = totalEthIn + amount;
}

hook CALL(uint g, address addr, uint256 value, uint argsOffset, uint argsLength, uint retOffset, uint retLength) {
    totalEthOut = totalEthOut + value;
}

invariant ethConservation()
    totalEthIn == totalEthOut + nativeBalances[currentContract]
```

#### Division Safety Rule Example
```cvl
rule noDivisionByZeroInDeposit {
    env e;
    
    // Setup: no NFTs staked
    require numStakedNfts() == 0;
    require e.msg.value > 0;
    
    // Attempt deposit
    deposit@withrevert(e);
    
    // Should revert with panic
    assert lastReverted;
}
```

#### State Machine Rule Example
```cvl
rule roundStateTransitions {
    env e;
    uint256 roundBefore = currentRound();
    RoundState stateBefore = getRoundState(roundBefore);
    
    // Perform any operation
    method f; calldataarg args;
    f(e, args);
    
    uint256 roundAfter = currentRound();
    RoundState stateAfter = getRoundState(roundAfter);
    
    // Verify valid transitions only
    assert stateBefore == RoundState.Inactive => 
           stateAfter == RoundState.Inactive || stateAfter == RoundState.Active;
    assert stateBefore == RoundState.Active => 
           stateAfter == RoundState.Active || stateAfter == RoundState.Claiming;
    assert stateBefore == RoundState.Claiming => 
           stateAfter == RoundState.Claiming || stateAfter == RoundState.Inactive;
}
```
