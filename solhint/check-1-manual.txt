    How to execute SolHint.

@ If necessary, edit "../.solhint.json".

@ Execute `./check-1.bash`.

@ After the script finishes, review its report file, which name is specified near Comment-202409124.

@ Use a reg-exp pattern like this to remove lines from the report file:

^.*? (?:no-empty-blocks|gas-multitoken1155|ordering|no-inline-assembly)\n
^.*? (?:gas-custom-errors|comprehensive-interface)\n

@ An alternative option is to execute the following command in the VS Code integrated terminal:

   npx hardhat check

   Then use Ctrl+Click to click links in the command output.
