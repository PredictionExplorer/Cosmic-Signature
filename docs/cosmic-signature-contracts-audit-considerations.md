### Cosmic Signature Contracts Audit Considerations

We recommned reviewing all documents seen in this project, including `${workspaceFolder}/README.md`, `./numbered-comments.md`, `./cosmic-signature-contracts-functional-requirements.md`.

Only contracts in the `${workspaceFolder}/contracts/production` folder, except `RandomWalkNFT` and its interface are to be audited. Those are to be deployed. `RandomWalkNFT` has already been deployed and the others are used for testing. Feel free to take a look at them as well, especially if you are going to review tests.

There are some comments in the project that are intended to be read by the auditor. To find them, perform a global search for `audit` (not whole word, case insensitive).
todo-0 Find those.
