Note: this document is legacy. Parts of still make some sense, but it does need a rewrite.

Execute the following commands:

	Open a terminal and:
	
	cd scripts
	./hardhat-node.bash

	Open one more terminal and:

	cd <this-folder>
		
	# todo-1 There is no such thing as runtime and maintenance modes any more. Now `roundActivationTime` plays that role.
	# (previously set switchToRuntimeMode=false and donateEthToCosmicSignatureGame=false to get maintenance mode with no transactions)
	npx hardhat deploy-cosmic-signature-contracts --deployconfigfilepath deploy-local.json --network localhost

	# Deploy new proxy implementation contract.
	COSMIC_SIGNATURE_GAME_ADDRESS=0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3 PRIVKEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80  npx hardhat run ./deploy-new-logic.js --network localhost

	# The new `CosmicSignatureGame` contract uses new state variable, `timesEthBidPrice`, the default value is set at "deploy-new-logic.js" but
	# you can change it running this script (note: only in maintenance mode!)) :
	# todo-1 There is no such thing as runtime and maintenance modes any more. Now `roundActivationTime` plays that role.
	COSMIC_SIGNATURE_GAME_ADDRESS=0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3 PRIVKEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80  npx hardhat run ./set-times-eth-bid-price.js --network localhost

	# Now we can use new bidding feature (bid can be as high as you want but bigger than current `nextEthBidPrice * timesEthBidPrice`).
	COSMIC_SIGNATURE_GAME_ADDRESS=0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3 PRIVKEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80  npx hardhat run ./bid-with-eth-open-bid.js --network localhost

Validation: bid operation should not fail (i.e. revert) , in etl/cmd/cosmicgme/scripts run ./cginfo script to dump state variables and check the bid price
