Execute the following commands:

	cd [to this directory]
	
	#in another terminal run:
	npx hardhat node

	#in another terminal run all the remaining commands:
	# todo-0 There is no such thing as runtime and maintenance modes any more. Now activation time plays that role.
	# (previously set switchToRuntime=false and donateToContract=false to get maintenance mode with no transactions)
	npx hardhat deploy-cosmicgame --deployconfig deploy-local.json --network localhost

	#deploy new proxy implementation contract contract
	COSMIC_GAME_PROXY_ADDRESS=0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3 PRIVKEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80  npx hardhat run ./deploy-newlogic.js --network localhost

	#the new CosmicGameImplementation contract uses new state variable, timesBidPrice, the default value is set at deploy-newlogic.js but
	#you can change it running this script (note: only in maintenance mode!)) :
	# todo-0 There is no such thing as runtime and maintenance modes any more. Now activation time plays that role.
	COSMIC_GAME_PROXY_ADDRESS=0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3 PRIVKEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80  npx hardhat run ./settimesbidprice.js --network localhost

	#now we can use new biding feature (bid can be as high as you want but bigger than current bidPrice * timesBidPrice)
	COSMIC_GAME_PROXY_ADDRESS=0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3 PRIVKEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80  npx hardhat run ./openBid.js --network localhost

Validation: bid operation should not fail (i.e. revert) , in etl/cmd/cosmicgme/scripts run ./cginfo script to dump state variables and check the bid price
