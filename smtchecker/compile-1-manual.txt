    How to execute SMTChecker.

@ Review https://github.com/PredictionExplorer/hardhat-preprocessor-integration-prototype/blob/main/contracts/Lock.sol
  for what you can possibly do in the code. Althoug that prototype goes beyond of what makes sense to do in the production code,
  and it's not necessarily OK to deploy as is, without preprocessing.

@ In the code, add asserts and whatever other relevant logic.

@ Prepend relevant code lines with 1 or more of the following comments:
// #enable_asserts 
// #disable_asserts 
// #enable_smtchecker 
// #disable_smtchecker 

  Remember to prepend any variables that are used only by asserts.
  Make sure the code is OK to deploy as is, without preprocessing.

@ Try to find the folowing case sensitive regular experssion patterns in source files. The findings might indicate mistakes.

(?<!// #enable)_asserts

(?<!// #enable_asserts )\bassert\s*\(

@ Review Comment-202409013.
  Specify there what contracts to analyze, or leave all commented.

@ Execute './compile-1.bash'.

@ While it's running, you might want to review "hardhat.config.js" to get an idea what's under the hood.

@ After the script finishes, review the newly created file in the subfolder specified near Comment-202409014.
