### high-level invariants ("natural language"-expressed)
	- Only owner can change timeout duration
	- Only game can send ETH and donated tokens
	- A roundâ€™s timeout is immutable once set at round registration.
	- Game contract can over-write timeouts and winner address for past rounds
	- Every deposit adds up balance to winner's account
	- Withdrawal of expired prizes by anyone is only possible after timeout, otherwise by winner only
	- Ownership of the ERC721 tokens is held on contract until withdrawal occurs
	- Ownership of the ERC20 tokens is held on holder contract instantiated per-round
### fine-grained invariantes (implementation based)
	- When winner address is set, timeout has non-zero value
	- roundNum for every winner is updated on every new ETH prize deposited by game contract
	- after ETH withdrawal roundNum and balance of the winner are zeroed
	- nextDonatedNftIndex is monotonic and never decreases
